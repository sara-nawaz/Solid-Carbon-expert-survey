- We need energy to do other stuff, as we should stop using fossil-fuel derived energy so should rationalize the way we use energy
- Most studies demonstrate that construction of wind mills is one of the renewable energy productions that demands the largest amount of rare and pollutants elements, like cobalt, rare earths etc.

For a start, you will have to drill several deep (several 1000 m) boreholes to get through the sediment layer. Then you would have to engineer the reservoir so that it is porous and permeable (old oceanic crust is not). Then the zone you pump into will become impermeable as you start to pump because the pore space will fill with carbonate. The capture and compression cycle is thermally inefficient. You are better off making electricity and using that to power the shore-side users. That way you save far more carbon from being released by displacing the need for fossil fuels.

It is clear from their research that afforestation and Bioenergy or Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage are far less effective and require vast amounts of land than existing growing forests, coastal wetlands and grasslands are capable of even greater carbon accumulation than they now do.
